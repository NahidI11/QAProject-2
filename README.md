## Brief

The objective of this project was to achieve the following:

• To create a web application that integrates with a database and demonstrates CRUD functionality.

• To utilise containers to host and deploy the application.

• To create a continuous integration (CI)/continuous deployment (CD) pipeline that will automatically test, build and deploy the application.


The application consists of the app and database in a single docker container.  The main focus has been to get the app up and running through a pipeline.  
Unfortunately, there is a lack of testing in the CI/CD pipeline due to gaps in knowledge on the subject.  Testing has not been covered in the course and due to lack of support or extensions for our projects I have not been able to integrate this.
