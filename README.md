## Brief

The objective of this project was to achieve the following:

• To create a web application that integrates with a database and demonstrates CRUD functionality.

• To utilise containers to host and deploy the application.

• To create a continuous integration (CI)/continuous deployment (CD) pipeline that will automatically test, build and deploy the application.


The application consists of the app and database in a single docker container.  The main focus has been to get the app up and running through a pipeline.  Unfortunately, there is a lack of testing in the CI/CD pipeline due to gaps in knowledge on the subject.  Testing has not been covered in the course and due to lack of support or extensions for our projects I have not been able to integrate this.


## Architecture

Below you can find my ERD, showing a one-to-many relationship:

## Tracking

I used Jira for Project Tracking as shown below:

## Risk Assessment

It is always important to carry out a risk assessment for any project as many different potential risks could arise. Below is a screenshot of my detailed risk assessment. This is where I have outlined potential risks, their impacts and mitigation techniques that we may need.
